# Omwro's Gaming Bot
### Thank you
Thank you for showing interest in my discord gaming bot.
This bot is created by a programmer who got bored and wanted
create something fun for his own discord server.

### Installation
You can add this discord bot easily to your discord server by linking on the link.
[Link.](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=623186472589197334&scope=bot&permissions=0)

You also need to create a new authentication(json) file to your main project
folder to make use of the bot. The file could be called "auth.json" and
should contain the following lines:
```
{
  "token": "", // Your own Bot Token
  "HiRez_devId": 0, // Your own HiRez developer ID
  "HiRez_authKey": "" // Your own HiRez developer authentication key
}
```
